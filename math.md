The given expression is `5 + 8 * 89 - 8 / 5`. To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

1. First, identify and perform any multiplication or division operations from left to right:
   - Multiply: \(8 \times 89 = 712\).
   - Divide: \(8 \div 5 = 1.6\).

2. Substitute these results back into the original expression:
   - The expression now becomes: `5 + 712 - 1.6`.

3. Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
   - Add: \(5 + 712 = 717\).
   - Subtract: \(717 - 1.6 = 715.4\).

Thus, by carefully following the order of operations, we find that the result of the expression `5 + 8 * 89 - 8 / 5` is \(715.4\).
